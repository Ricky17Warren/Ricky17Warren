## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a backend engineer focused on designing and implementing event-driven systems using technologies like Apache Kafka and MongoDB. This space is where I share personal projects, system architecture experiments, and practical implementations aimed at building scalable, resilient backend services.

My work revolves around creating systems that handle high-throughput data, asynchronous workflows, and loosely coupled services. Iâ€™m particularly interested in event streaming patterns, real-time processing, and how systems can be designed to scale effectively while remaining maintainable. Kafka plays a central role in many of these projects as the event backbone, enabling microservices to communicate efficiently and reliably. MongoDB complements this architecture with flexible, schema-less storage that's well-suited for dynamic data models.

In this repository, youâ€™ll find a variety of backend-focused projects that showcase concepts like producer/consumer patterns, message serialization (Avro/JSON), event sourcing, and data persistence strategies. Many of these projects integrate with other technologies such as Docker, REST APIs, and monitoring tools to create a complete picture of how event-driven applications function in real-world environments.

Code readability, fault tolerance, and scalability are key principles I follow in each build. I strive to write clear, modular code with proper documentation to make it accessible for others who are learning or working on similar architectures.

If youâ€™re exploring distributed systems, microservices, or event-driven design, I hope you find something helpful or inspiring in these projects. Collaboration, questions, and contributions are always welcomeâ€”I believe learning and growth are best when shared.

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to dive into the code, open an issue, or fork a project. Letâ€™s build systems that are not only powerful, but built to evolve.
